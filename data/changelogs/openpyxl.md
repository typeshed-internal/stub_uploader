## 3.0.4.6 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 3.0.4.5 (2023-01-18)

Improve pre-commit config (#9563)

- Add a few more hooks. These are all very fast, and I've found them useful in other projects:
  - Autofixes:
    - `trailing-whitespace`: fixes trailing whitespace
    - `requirements-txt-fixer`: alphabetises items in `requirements.txt` files
    - `end-of-file-fixer`: makes sure every file ends with a single newline character
    - `mixed-line-ending`: Makes sure Windows users don't accidentally introduce CRLF line endings into a file that uses LF line endings
  - None-autofixes:
    - `check-yaml`: loads YAML files to validate syntax
    - `check-toml`: loads TOML files to validate syntax
    - `check-merge-conflict`: detects merge-conflict strings in files and blocks them from accidentally being committed
    - `check-case-conflict`: checks for files with names that would conflict on a case-insensitive filesystem like MacOS HFS+ or Windows FAT; blocks them from being committed.
  - Change the bot schedule to quarterly, to reduce noisy PRs
  - Change the `black` language target-version to Python 3.10, synching the setting here with the changes that were made to our `pyproject.toml` file in #7538
