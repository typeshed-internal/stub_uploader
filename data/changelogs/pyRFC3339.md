[stubsabot] Mark pyRFC3339 as obsolete since 2.1.0 ([#14633](https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/14633))

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 1.1.1.2 (2023-02-15)

Use `typing_extensions.Self` instead of `_typeshed.Self` (#9702)

## 1.1.1.1 (2022-11-21)

## 1.1.0 (2021-10-12)

Also remove the python2 markers of packages that don't list Python 2
as supported in the latest version.

Don't special case version '0.1'
