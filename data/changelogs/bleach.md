## 6.0.0.5 (2023-10-04)

[bleach] Add html5lib_shim.Filter__init__/__iter__ (#10835)

The missing __init__ method caused `Filter` to be incompatible
with the `_Filter` protocol, preventing valid initialization of
`Cleaner` instances.

Closes: #10834

## 6.0.0.4 (2023-07-20)

Add an upstream_repository field to METADATA.toml (#10487)

Closes: #10478

## 6.0.0.3 (2023-05-10)

Add `partial_stub` metadata field (#10157)

## 6.0.0.2 (2023-03-27)

Add defaults for third-party stubs A-D (#9952)

## 6.0.0.1 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.
