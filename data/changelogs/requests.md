## 2.31.0.20240125 (2024-01-25)

Add parameter type to PreparedRequest.prepare_content_length (#11304)

## 2.31.0.20240106 (2024-01-06)

Update typing_extensions imports in third-party stubs (#11245)

## 2.31.0.20231231 (2023-12-31)

requests: Use the `Any` trick in `HTTPError` (#11207)

## 2.31.0.10 (2023-10-18)

requests: annotate `utils.get_encoding_from_headers()` (#10901)

## 2.31.0.9 (2023-10-13)

[requests] Allow HTTPError.response to be None (#10875)

This aligns with the definition in requests, but means that user code might
need additional assertions to ensure that `HTTPError.response` is not `None`.

## 2.31.0.8 (2023-10-05)

`types-requests`, `types-influxdb-client`: add note to the PyPI readme about the `urllib3` pin (#10839)

## 2.31.0.7 (2023-10-01)

Remove stubs for `urllib3` (#10812)

Both types-requests and types-influxdb-client now depend on urllib3>=2 instead of types-urllib3. That in turn means that types-caldav, types-slumber and types-requests-oauthlib all depend indirectly on urllib3>=2, since all three stubs packages depend on types-requests.

## 2.31.0.6 (2023-09-27)

[requests] loosen HTTPError constructor (#10776)

## 2.31.0.5 (2023-09-25)

Co-authored-by: Alex Waygood <Alex.Waygood@Gmail.com>

## 2.31.0.2 (2023-07-20)

Add an upstream_repository field to METADATA.toml (#10487)

Closes: #10478

## 2.31.0.1 (2023-05-29)

Allowlist requests.compat.bytes.__buffer__ (#10231)

## 2.31.0.0 (2023-05-23)

[stubsabot] Bump requests to 2.31.* (#10199)

Release: https://pypi.org/pypi/requests/2.31.0
Homepage: https://requests.readthedocs.io
Diff: https://github.com/psf/requests/compare/v2.30.0...v2.31.0

Stubsabot analysis of the diff between the two releases:
 - 0 public Python files have been added.
 - 0 files included in typeshed's stubs have been deleted.
 - 2 files included in typeshed's stubs have been modified or renamed: `requests/__version__.py`, `requests/sessions.py`.
 - Total lines of Python code added: 26.
 - Total lines of Python code deleted: 4.

## 2.30.0.0 (2023-05-05)

[requests] Update stubs to 2.30 (#10141)

## 2.29.0.0 (2023-04-29)

Update `requests` for v2.29 (#10097)

## 2.28.11.17 (2023-03-28)

Add defaults for third-party stubs Q-T (#9959)

## 2.28.11.16 (2023-03-22)

Add type to requests.models.RequestEncodingMixin.path_url (#9923)

We can see at https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/7f694b79e114c06fac5ec06019cada5a61e5570f/requests/models.py#L104 that this always returns a string.

## 2.28.11.15 (2023-02-26)

Improve many `__(a)exit__` annotations (#9696)

## 2.28.11.14 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 2.28.11.13 (2023-02-15)

Use `typing_extensions.Self` instead of `_typeshed.Self` (#9702)

## 2.28.11.12 (2023-02-07)

Improve pyright verification of third-party test cases in CI (#9650)

Co-authored-by: Avasam <samuel.06@hotmail.com>

Bump mypy to 1.0 (#9684)

## 2.28.11.9 (2023-02-06)

Use `OSError` instead of `IOError` (#9683)

## 2.28.11.8 (2023-01-18)

Replace `Any` with `Incomplete` in many places (#9558)

## 2.28.11.7 (2022-12-22)

`requests`: set `session.headers` to `MutableMapping` (#9395)

Annotate known magic-method return types (#9131)

## 2.28.11.3 (2022-11-08)

Fix and allow classes with missing metaclasses (#9136)

## 2.28.11.2 (2022-10-07)

Mark `requests` stubs as complete (#8858)

Co-authored-by: Kevin Kirsche <kevin.kirsche@one.verizon.com>

## 2.28.11.1 (2022-10-04)

`requests`: Add regression test for #8762 (#8835)

The final mypy_primer report for #8762 was an empty diff. Considering the number of issues we've had with our requests stubs over the last year, it feels like it makes sense to add a test case to make sure that it doesn't regress.

## 2.28.11 (2022-09-22)

`requests`: improve `_Data` type (#8762)

requests: improve _Data type

This allows to pass an Iterable[bytes] for streaming request data.

## 2.28.10 (2022-09-08)

Add infrastructure allowing for test cases for third-party stubs (#8700)

- Move the logic for running mypy on the test cases from `tests/mypy_test.py` to a separate script, `tests/regr_test.py`.
- Add the necessary logic in order to be able to have test cases for third-party stubs.
- Move logic common to `tests/mypy_test.py` and `tests/regr_test.py` into `tests/colors.py`, and rename `tests/colors.py` to `tests/utils.py`.
- Add a new check to `tests/check_consistent.py`, to enforce the use of `# pyright: reportUnnecessaryTypeIgnoreComment=true` comments in third-party test cases. These are essential if we want to have our tests against false-negatives work with pyright.
- Update the relevant documentation to account for the new test file.
- Add a new job to the `tests.yml` GitHub workflow, to run the new test in CI.
- Add a simple proof-of-concept test case for `requests`, as a regression test for #7998.

## 2.28.3 (2022-07-21)

requests: add annotation for `parse_header_links` (#8349)

In the requests package the function `utils.parse_header_links()`
takes a str as input and returns a list of dictionaries.

This can be seen in the unit tests that are used:

Third-party stubs: fix several fictitious type aliases (#7958)

## 2.27.28 (2022-05-26)

requests: allow immutable headers (#7932)

## 2.27.27 (2022-05-19)

Fix requests.Session().hooks (#7871)

Fixes #7776

Mutating hooks, as in `session.hooks['response'] = ...`, should work. Reassigning it like `session.hooks = ...` is probably a bad idea, so it will always be a `dict`.

## 2.27.26 (2022-05-16)

`requests`: Fix type of request headers (#7773)

Allow bytes values. In `Session` methods, `None` can be used to ignore the session's headers.

## 2.27.25 (2022-04-29)

Delete python 2 branches from third-party stubs (#7741)

Since #7703, we no longer have third-party stubs that support Python 2, so code like `if sys.version_info >= (3, 0)` can be simplified.

## 2.27.24 (2022-04-28)

requests: allow non-mutable Mapping for files/hooks parameters (#7732)

## 2.27.23 (2022-04-28)

Third-party stubs: Improve several `__exit__` methods (#7575)

## 2.27.15 (2022-03-27)

requests: Update adapters.pyi (#7544)

The cert can be
* A string / bytes which is a path to a certfile
* A tuple with two string / bytes, where the first is the certfile and the second is a keyfile
* None (optional)

The tuple could be anything indexable, but there are strict requirement to actualle have two items, don't know if there is something more generic

See https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requests/adapters.py#L242-L248

## 2.27.14 (2022-03-19)

PEP 604: Remove some more uses of Union/Optional (#7515)

The following patterns still break mypy:

1. `type[]` at top level fails
2. `tuple[T1, T2]` at top level fails (but `tuple[T1, ...]` is fine)
3. `T1 | Callable[..., T2 | T3]` fails, but only <=3.9

This PR cleans up usage of `Union` and `Optional` outside these patterns.

## 2.27.13 (2022-03-16)

Use PEP 604 syntax wherever possible (#7493)

## 2.27.12 (2022-03-13)

Update Session.prepare_request, .get_adapter (#6058)

## 2.25.7 (2021-09-20)

Support name, content-type and headers in file upload (#6052)

See https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#post-a-multipart-encoded-file.
