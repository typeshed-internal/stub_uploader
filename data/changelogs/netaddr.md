## 1.0.0.20240212 (2024-02-12)

## 0.9.0.1 (2023-09-23)

stdlib/xml/sax: Add type annotations ([#10606](https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/10606))

* stdlib/xml/sax: Type annotations for commonly used methods.

* stdlib/xml/sax: More annotations.

It turns out SAX's definition of a "qname" is exactly the opposite of
ElementTree's. With that understanding, let's annotate the Attributes*Impl
classes too.

* stdlib/xml/sax: I better understand what AttributesNSImpl is doing now.

* Update third-party library stubs to agree with the new SAX annotations.
