## 0.9.0.2 (2023-12-19)

## 0.9.0.1 (2023-09-23)

stdlib/xml/sax: Add type annotations (#10606)

* stdlib/xml/sax: Type annotations for commonly used methods.

* stdlib/xml/sax: More annotations.

It turns out SAX's definition of a "qname" is exactly the opposite of
ElementTree's. With that understanding, let's annotate the Attributes*Impl
classes too.

* stdlib/xml/sax: I better understand what AttributesNSImpl is doing now.

* Update third-party library stubs to agree with the new SAX annotations.

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.
