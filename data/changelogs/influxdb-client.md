## 1.37.0.1 (2023-10-01)

Remove stubs for `urllib3` (#10812)

Both types-requests and types-influxdb-client now depend on urllib3>=2 instead of types-urllib3. That in turn means that types-caldav, types-slumber and types-requests-oauthlib all depend indirectly on urllib3>=2, since all three stubs packages depend on types-requests.
