## 0.8.0.1 (2023-03-08)

Replace `object | None` with `object` (#9857)

All types, including `None`, are a subtype of `object`, so `None` is redundant in the union `object | None`.

## 0.8.0.0 (2023-03-06)

Update `console-menu` stubs for v0.8 (#9845)

## 0.7.0.3 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 0.7.0.2 (2023-01-18)

Replace `Any` with `Incomplete` in many places (#9565)

## 0.7.0.1 (2022-10-20)

Remove `consolemenu` from `pyright`'s exclude (#8940)

## 0.7.0.0 (2022-10-03)

Add type stubs for package console-menu (#8820)
