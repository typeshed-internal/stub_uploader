## 0.2.16.6 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 0.2.16.5 (2022-12-27)

`pyaudio`: fix stubtest failures (#9416)

## 0.2.16.4 (2022-11-24)

Add support for Homebrew and Chocolatey (#9187)

## 0.2.16.3 (2022-11-16)

Add missing symbols in `pyaudio` stubs (#9206)

Split off from #9187
Turned off `ignore_missing_stub` for pyaudio stubs.
Ensured it's valid for Windows and MacOS.

## 0.2.16.2 (2022-11-14)

Improve `ast` types; revert several "redundant numeric union" changes from #7906 (#9130)

* Adapt number types in ast

Since mypy  0.990 type promotions was limited.
This means that complex is not longer promoted to int/float, therefore
we should adapt the types to list all possible types

stubtest: use separate table in METADATA.toml (#8096)

## 0.2.15 (2022-05-21)

Simplify and correct many numeric unions (#7906)

## 0.2.13 (2022-04-27)

Drop Python 2 support in third-party stubs (#7703)

## 0.2.12 (2022-04-16)

Use `TypeAlias` where possible for type aliases (#7630)

## 0.2.11 (2022-03-19)

PEP 604: Remove some more uses of Union/Optional (#7515)

The following patterns still break mypy:

1. `type[]` at top level fails
2. `tuple[T1, T2]` at top level fails (but `tuple[T1, ...]` is fine)
3. `T1 | Callable[..., T2 | T3]` fails, but only <=3.9

This PR cleans up usage of `Union` and `Optional` outside these patterns.

Use PEP 604 syntax wherever possible (#7493)

Replace METADATA stubtest key with stubtest_apt_packages (#6704)

## 0.2.5 (2021-12-25)
