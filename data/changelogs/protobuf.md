## 3.19.11 (2022-02-08)

protobuf: Bring back Message.Extensions (#7154)

## 3.19.10 (2022-02-07)

## 3.19.8 (2022-02-02)

Add/fix types to a bunch of non-generated protobuf files (#7017)

## 3.19.7 (2022-01-29)

Use relax_strict_optional_primitives on protobuf generated code (#7038)

Per the suggestion in https://github.com/dropbox/mypy-protobuf/issues/344
This generates more permissive constructors (which protobuf itself actually
accepts).

Philosophically, I think it makes sense for the generated code hosted on
typeshed to be most permissive, while the generated code of individual
projects can make individual decisions (defaulting to less permissive).

## 3.19.6 (2022-01-24)

Bump to mypy-protobuf 3.2.0 (#7013)

## 3.19.5 (2022-01-20)

Remove nearly all `__str__` and `__repr__` methods from typeshed (#6968)

## 3.19.4 (2022-01-19)

Use `_typeshed.Self` in `protobuf/google/protobuf/message.pyi` (#6955)

Use PEP 585 syntax in Python 2, `protobuf` & `_ast` stubs, where possible (#6949)

Flatten stubtest_allowlist for protobuf generated files (#6944)

I added stubtest testing for generated files within mypy-protobuf.
There are many ways in which the protobuf code is doing *weird*
things and we want the stubs to look a bit different. They're enumerated
in the `stubtest_allowlist.txt` of mypy-protobuf, so squashing them here
so that this one can focus on the non-generated files.
