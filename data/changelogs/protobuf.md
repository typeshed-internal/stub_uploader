[stubsabot] Bump protobuf to 4.24.* (#10545)

Release: https://pypi.org/pypi/protobuf/4.24.0
Homepage: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

Co-authored-by: Alex Waygood <Alex.Waygood@Gmail.com>

## 4.23.0.3 (2023-08-07)

Add missing stubs in google.protobuf.message_factory module (#10537)

## 4.23.0.2 (2023-07-22)

Pretend `_EnumTypeWrapper` inherits from `type` (#10203)

Pretend `google.protobuf.internal.enum_type_wrapper._EnumTypeWrapper` inherits from `type`. It doesn't really, but this makes type checkers stop complaining when you use it as a metaclass, which is the only reason the class exists.

## 4.23.0.1 (2023-05-10)

Add `partial_stub` metadata field (#10157)

## 4.23.0.0 (2023-05-09)

Release: https://pypi.org/pypi/protobuf/4.23.0
Homepage: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

## 4.22.0.2 (2023-04-04)

Various improvements to non-generated `protobuf` stubs (#10010)

## 4.22.0.1 (2023-04-03)

Fix return type of protobuf.ScalarMap.get() (#9996)

## 4.22.0.0 (2023-02-28)

Update protobuf for v4.22 (#9824)

## 4.21.0.7 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 4.21.0.6 (2023-02-15)

Use `typing_extensions.Self` instead of `_typeshed.Self` (#9702)

## 4.21.0.5 (2023-02-07)

Improve pyright verification of third-party test cases in CI (#9650)

Co-authored-by: Avasam <samuel.06@hotmail.com>

## 4.21.0.4 (2023-02-02)

Manual changes of `Any` union to `Incomplete` in stubs folder (#9566)

- ClassVar[Any | None]
- Missed previous changes due to alias
- Manual review of leftover Any unions (`| Any` and `Any |`)

## 4.21.0.3 (2023-01-18)

Replace `Any` with `Incomplete` in many places (#9558)

## 4.21.0.2 (2022-12-05)

`protobuf`: Annotate `well_known_types.pyi` (#9323)

Co-authored-by: Alex Waygood <Alex.Waygood@Gmail.com>

## 4.21.0.1 (2022-11-28)

Improve annotations for `__instancecheck__`, `__subclasscheck__` (#9291)

## 4.21.0.0 (2022-11-25)

Bump protobuf to 4.21.*; delete `google/__init__.pyi` (#8360)

This major version bump of the stubs package deletes google/__init__.py, which does not exist at runtime, and caused problems for several users. Mypy now has --namespace-packages enabled by default, which should hopefully mean that this causes minimal pain.

## 3.20.4.6 (2022-11-23)

protobuf: Add some return types (#9259)

## 3.20.4.5 (2022-11-14)

Improve `ast` types; revert several "redundant numeric union" changes from #7906 (#9130)

* Adapt number types in ast

Since mypy  0.990 type promotions was limited.
This means that complex is not longer promoted to int/float, therefore
we should adapt the types to list all possible types

## 3.20.0 (2022-08-25)

Bump protobuf to 3.20.1 (#8609)

There are even newer versions available (4.*), but I had found a bug
in it which prevented it from working with mypy-protobuf. For now,
sticking to just 3.20.1

This reverts commit a11a6643a7599c352ae11ac1b08dc5f3d71b106c.

## 3.19.14 (2022-03-21)

Remove google/__init__.pyi (#6106)

Since google is a namespace package, it won't have an init.
Depends on https://github.com/typeshed-internal/stub_uploader/pull/33

## 3.19.13 (2022-03-17)

Use PEP 604 syntax in non-autogenerated protobuf stubs (#7506)

Co-authored-by: Jelle Zijlstra <jelle.zijlstra@gmail.com>

## 3.19.8 (2022-02-02)

Add/fix types to a bunch of non-generated protobuf files (#7017)

## 3.19.7 (2022-01-29)

Use relax_strict_optional_primitives on protobuf generated code (#7038)

Per the suggestion in https://github.com/dropbox/mypy-protobuf/issues/344
This generates more permissive constructors (which protobuf itself actually
accepts).

Philosophically, I think it makes sense for the generated code hosted on
typeshed to be most permissive, while the generated code of individual
projects can make individual decisions (defaulting to less permissive).

## 3.19.6 (2022-01-24)

Bump to mypy-protobuf 3.2.0 (#7013)

## 3.19.5 (2022-01-20)

Remove nearly all `__str__` and `__repr__` methods from typeshed (#6968)

Use `_typeshed.Self` in `protobuf/google/protobuf/message.pyi` (#6955)

Use PEP 585 syntax in Python 2, `protobuf` & `_ast` stubs, where possible (#6949)

Flatten stubtest_allowlist for protobuf generated files (#6944)

I added stubtest testing for generated files within mypy-protobuf.
There are many ways in which the protobuf code is doing *weird*
things and we want the stubs to look a bit different. They're enumerated
in the `stubtest_allowlist.txt` of mypy-protobuf, so squashing them here
so that this one can focus on the non-generated files.
