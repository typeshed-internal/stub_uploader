## 22.1.0.9 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 22.1.0.8 (2023-02-15)

Use `typing_extensions.Self` instead of `_typeshed.Self` (#9702)

## 22.1.0.7 (2023-02-09)

Use `_typeshed.FileDescriptorOrPath` in stubs (#9695)

## 22.1.0.6 (2023-01-18)

Improve pre-commit config (#9563)

- Add a few more hooks. These are all very fast, and I've found them useful in other projects:
  - Autofixes:
    - `trailing-whitespace`: fixes trailing whitespace
    - `requirements-txt-fixer`: alphabetises items in `requirements.txt` files
    - `end-of-file-fixer`: makes sure every file ends with a single newline character
    - `mixed-line-ending`: Makes sure Windows users don't accidentally introduce CRLF line endings into a file that uses LF line endings
  - None-autofixes:
    - `check-yaml`: loads YAML files to validate syntax
    - `check-toml`: loads TOML files to validate syntax
    - `check-merge-conflict`: detects merge-conflict strings in files and blocks them from accidentally being committed
    - `check-case-conflict`: checks for files with names that would conflict on a case-insensitive filesystem like MacOS HFS+ or Windows FAT; blocks them from being committed.
  - Change the bot schedule to quarterly, to reduce noisy PRs
  - Change the `black` language target-version to Python 3.10, synching the setting here with the changes that were made to our `pyproject.toml` file in #7538

## 0.8.4 (2022-03-07)

Improve open overloads when mode is a literal union (#7428)

As pointed out by @gvanrossum in https://github.com/python/typing/issues/1096

Improves type inference in cases when we know that mode is
OpenBinaryMode, but don't know anything more specific:
```
def my_open(name: str, write: bool):
    mode: Literal['rb', 'wb'] = 'wb' if write else 'rb'
    with open(name, mode) as f:
        reveal_type(f)  # previously typing.IO[Any], now typing.BinaryIO
```

You may be tempted into thinking this is some limitation of type
checkers. mypy does in fact have logic for detecting if we match
multiple overloads and union-ing up the return types of matched
overloads. The problem is the last overload interferes with this logic.
That is, if you remove the fallback overload (prior to this PR), you'd get
"Union[io.BufferedReader, io.BufferedWriter]" in the above example.
