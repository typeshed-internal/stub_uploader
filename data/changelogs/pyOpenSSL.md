## 23.0.0.4 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 23.0.0.3 (2023-02-13)

pyOpenSSL: Introduce PARTIAL_CHAIN constant (#9727)

## 23.0.0.2 (2023-01-18)

Replace `Any` with `Incomplete` in many places (#9565)

## 23.0.0.1 (2023-01-10)

Delete stubs for `cryptography` (#9459)

Typeshed's stubs for `paramiko` and `pyOpenSSL` now depend on the `cryptography` package, which now provides inline types at runtime

## 23.0.0.0 (2023-01-03)
