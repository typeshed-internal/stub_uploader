psycopg2: Fix missing `Protocol` base class in file protocols (#10943)

- Add a few more hooks. These are all very fast, and I've found them useful in other projects:
  - Autofixes:
    - `trailing-whitespace`: fixes trailing whitespace
    - `requirements-txt-fixer`: alphabetises items in `requirements.txt` files
    - `end-of-file-fixer`: makes sure every file ends with a single newline character
    - `mixed-line-ending`: Makes sure Windows users don't accidentally introduce CRLF line endings into a file that uses LF line endings
  - None-autofixes:
    - `check-yaml`: loads YAML files to validate syntax
    - `check-toml`: loads TOML files to validate syntax
    - `check-merge-conflict`: detects merge-conflict strings in files and blocks them from accidentally being committed
    - `check-case-conflict`: checks for files with names that would conflict on a case-insensitive filesystem like MacOS HFS+ or Windows FAT; blocks them from being committed.
  - Change the bot schedule to quarterly, to reduce noisy PRs
  - Change the `black` language target-version to Python 3.10, synching the setting here with the changes that were made to our `pyproject.toml` file in #7538

## 2.9.21 (2022-08-21)

Improve return type for psycopg2 connect function (#8567)

When a `connection_factory` argument is provided to psycopg2's `connect` function, the function's return type now matches that of the factory output class. However, if `cursor_factory` is set and has a non-`None` value and/or `connection_factory` is not set or is `None`, the return type is simply `connection`, as before.

## 2.9.20 (2022-08-17)

Additional return types for psycopg2 connections (#8528)

* Return types for psycopg2 dict connections

DB connection and cursor methods that deal with `dict`-style results now indicate the expected return types as implemented.

* Return types for psycopg2 namedtuple connections

DB connection and cursor methods that deal with `namedtuple` results now indicate the expected return types as implemented.

* Use ABC iterator

As required by flake8, the `Iterator` referenced in psycopg2's `extras` module has been switched to the `collections.abc.Iterator[T]` variant.

* Fix base psycopg2 cursor iter return type

The previous return type of `Self` is wrong; `cursor`'s `__iter__` method returns an `Iterator`.

* Correct return type for cursor iter and next methods

The previous attempt to fix the return type of `cursor`'s (and subclasses) `__iter__` method was misguided; they should indeed return `Self`. It's the `__next__` methods that had to be updated to return the correct record/row instance type.

* Comprehensive overloads for psycopg2 extra connections

Provides full method signatures for the `cursor` methods of the `DictConnection`, `RealDictConnection` and `NamedTupleConnection` types. Notably this includes a default value for `cursor_factory` in each case, while preserving the option to override the parameter manually.

* Have mypy ignore incompatible psycopg2 return types

The return types of the `fetch*` and `__next__` methods of `DictCursor`, `RealDictCursor` and `NamedTupleCursor` are incompatible with the base `cursor` class's corresponding methods' return types. However, this does accurately reflect reality, so ignore the mypy errors in those cases.

* Use ABC callable for psycopg2 extras module

As required by flake8, the `Callable` referenced in psycopg2's `extras` module has been switched to the `Callable` variant.

* Remove superfluous psycopg2 member overrides

Several members in the `DictCursorBase` type definition were entirely unnecessary, so they have been removed. In addition, adds a type to the `size` param of the `cursor`'s `fetchmany` method.

Annotations for psycopg2.ConnectionInfo (#7834)

* Annotations for psycopg2.ConnectionInfo

These annotations come from the documentation here:

https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extensions.html#psycopg2.extensions.ConnectionInfo
If there was doubt, I referred to the libpq documentation cited by
psycopg2's docs.

I wasn't completely sure about `dsn_parameters`. Psycopg2's docs list it
as an `dict`, and the example suggests it's a `dict[str, str]` at that.
From psycopg2's source I found

    https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/blob/1d3a89a0bba621dc1cc9b32db6d241bd2da85ad1/psycopg/conninfo_type.c#L183-L206

which is implemented here:

    https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/blob/1d3a89a0bba621dc1cc9b32db6d241bd2da85ad1/psycopg/utils.c#L251-L279

I'm no expert in CPython's API, but this looks to me like it's building
a `dict[str, str]`.

Additionally, the libpq docs

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PQCONNINFO
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PQCONNDEFAULTS

show that the underlying data just consists of strings.

Additionally, I'm pretty sure from this chunk of source

    https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/blob/1d3a89a0bba621dc1cc9b32db6d241bd2da85ad1/psycopg/conninfo_type.c#L581-L598

That `ConnectionInfo.__init__` takes one positional-only argument, which
must be a `psycopg2.connection`. But I don't think users are intended to
be constructing this type, so I've not added that annotation.

* Annotate `connection.info` and related attributes

* Make ConnectionInfo attributes properties

According to https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/blob/1d3a89a0bba621dc1cc9b32db6d241bd2da85ad1/psycopg/conninfo_type.c#L534-L563

* Mark connection attributes as readonly

according to https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/blob/8ef195f2ff187454cc709d7857235676bb4176ee/psycopg/connection_type.c#L1244

* Explain why some properties aren't `T | None`

psycopg2: correct return type (#7607)

Fixes the return type of `psycopg2.cursor.fetchone()` to match the psycopg2 code:
