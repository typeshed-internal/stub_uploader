`gdb-stubs` fixes (#9439)

* fix: Union subprinters with `None`

See https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/a4418a9c6f99fd31c51698b1f6a6f8dbc1b81b6f/gdb/python/lib/gdb/printing.py#L52-L55

* fix: Allow callables as argument to `printer`

See https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/a4418a9c6f99fd31c51698b1f6a6f8dbc1b81b6f/gdb/python/lib/gdb/printing.py#L77 and the description of "function / old way" in the body of `register_pretty_printer`.

The new union's signature is equivalent to `gdb.printing.PrettyPrinter(...).__call__`.

* fix: make `gdb.Block` iterable over `gdb.Symbol`

See https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Blocks-In-Python.html#Blocks-In-Python:

> A gdb.Block is iterable. The iterator returns the symbols (see [Symbols In Python](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Symbols-In-Python.html#Symbols-In-Python)) local to the block.

Implementation of `gdb.BlockIterator` is given in https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/gdb-12-branch/gdb/python/py-block.c. As with many of the other classes, `BlockIterator` is actually imported from the built-in `_gdb` module (https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/a4418a9c6f99fd31c51698b1f6a6f8dbc1b81b6f/gdb/python/lib/gdb/__init__.py#L28).

## 12.1.4.1 (2022-12-28)

Add type stubs for gdb.Value comparison operators (#9411)

## 12.1.4 (2022-09-24)

gdb: add missing automatic imports (#8788)

When GDB has just started, several `gdb` submodules are automatically
loaded, so user code does not have to manually import them (for instance
`import gdb.events`). Reflect that in `gdb` stubs.

## 12.1.3 (2022-07-07)

Fix various `TypeAlias` issues (#8248)

## 12.1.2 (2022-06-23)

Various fixes in `gdb` (#8144)

* gdb.events.BreakpointEvent: fix various typos

* gdb.printing: remove GenPrinterFunction

This was meant to be a private type alias, but it is unused and a
duplicate of the better named gdb._PrettyPrinterLookupFunction.

## 12.1.1 (2022-06-19)

stubtest: use separate table in METADATA.toml (#8096)

## 12.1.0 (2022-06-15)

Add stubs for "gdb" (#8013)

This commit adds type stubs for the "gdb" package, the Python API to
extend GDB (https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Python-API.html).
