## 25.1.0.20250815 (2025-08-15)

[django-filter] Improve constructor param types and add missing re-exports ([#14556](https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/14556))

* Accept `StrOrPromise` for field labels -- allow Django lazy translated strings.
* Added `__init__` params that are inherited from parent classes. Reduced usage of loosely typed `*args, **kwargs`.
* Removed `__init__` method type hints from classes whose parameters are same as parent class -- to avoid duplicating them.
* Added missing re-exports to `django_filters/rest_framework/__init__.pyi` -- the imports in this file are clearly meant as re-export

[django-filter] Replace list with more generic Sequence ([#14567](https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/14567))
