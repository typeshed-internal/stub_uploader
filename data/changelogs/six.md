Closes: #10478

Add defaults for third-party stubs Q-T (#9959)

## 1.16.21.7 (2023-03-08)

All types, including `None`, are a subtype of `object`, so `None` is redundant in the union `object | None`.

## 1.16.21.5 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

six: Remove unused `__future__` import (#8790)

## 1.16.19 (2022-08-23)

`six`: Fix incorrect `type[type[Any]]` annotation (#8599)

Mypy will (correctly, I think) start flagging `type[type[Any]]` as an illegal annotation when mypy 0.980 comes out. Let's fix it now, before it comes out.

## 1.16.18 (2022-07-12)

Import `Match` and `Pattern` from `re`, not `typing` (#8277)

Add missing definitions to six.moves.http_client (#7615)

These were removed as a side-effect of #7327, which added
`__all__` to `http.client`. I checked that all the definitions
are present at runtime via `six.moves.http_client`.
