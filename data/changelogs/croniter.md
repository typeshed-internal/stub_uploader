[stubsabot] Bump croniter to 2.0.* (#10863)

Release: https://pypi.org/pypi/croniter/2.0.0
Homepage: http://github.com/kiorky/croniter
Repository: https://github.com/kiorky/croniter
Diff: https://github.com/kiorky/croniter/compare/1.4.1...2.0.0

Stubsabot analysis of the diff between the two releases:
 - Total lines of Python code added: 13.
 - Total lines of Python code deleted: 8.

## 1.4.0.1 (2023-07-20)

Add an upstream_repository field to METADATA.toml (#10487)

Closes: #10478

## 1.4.0.0 (2023-06-21)

Bump croniter to 1.4 (#10341)

Also require `bytes` for all `hash_id`s for consistency, even
if some methods might work with other types as well. But
using other types might hint at some inconsistent type
usage and be a source of possible bugs.

Update `croniter` to 1.3.10 (#10027)

Co-authored-by: Alex Waygood <Alex.Waygood@Gmail.com>

## 1.3.2.7 (2023-03-27)

Add defaults for third-party stubs A-D (#9952)

## 1.3.2.5 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 1.3.2.4 (2023-02-15)

Use `typing_extensions.Self` instead of `_typeshed.Self` (#9702)

## 1.3.2.3 (2023-01-29)

croniter: complete stubs (#9584)

## 1.3.2.2 (2023-01-18)

Improve pre-commit config (#9563)

- Add a few more hooks. These are all very fast, and I've found them useful in other projects:
  - Autofixes:
    - `trailing-whitespace`: fixes trailing whitespace
    - `requirements-txt-fixer`: alphabetises items in `requirements.txt` files
    - `end-of-file-fixer`: makes sure every file ends with a single newline character
    - `mixed-line-ending`: Makes sure Windows users don't accidentally introduce CRLF line endings into a file that uses LF line endings
  - None-autofixes:
    - `check-yaml`: loads YAML files to validate syntax
    - `check-toml`: loads TOML files to validate syntax
    - `check-merge-conflict`: detects merge-conflict strings in files and blocks them from accidentally being committed
    - `check-case-conflict`: checks for files with names that would conflict on a case-insensitive filesystem like MacOS HFS+ or Windows FAT; blocks them from being committed.
  - Change the bot schedule to quarterly, to reduce noisy PRs
  - Change the `black` language target-version to Python 3.10, synching the setting here with the changes that were made to our `pyproject.toml` file in #7538
