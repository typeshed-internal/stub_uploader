## 5.7.0.5 (2023-05-01)

Convert the remaining ujson uses of AnyStr (#10086)

Followup from #10081

## 5.7.0.4 (2023-04-25)

Loosen constraints on ujson file functions (#10081)

Like `json.dump`, `ujson.dump` takes any object that has a
string-accepting `.write` method.

Similarly, `ujson.load` works with any object with a `.read()` that
returns either a string or a bytes

## 5.7.0.3 (2023-04-13)

Make most ujson.dump() parameters keyword-only (#10044)

## 5.7.0.2 (2023-04-12)

## 5.7.0.1 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.
